### Enhanced Roadmap for Frontend Development with Next.js and Tailwind CSS

**Introduction**
This roadmap ensures that all backend features from the provided `api-docs.json` file are implemented in the frontend, leveraging the tech stack: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN/UI. Each feature aligns with corresponding API endpoints for seamless integration.

---

  - Manage users: View, update, and delete (`GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE /users/{userId}`).
  - Role management: Assign roles (`PUT /roles/{id}`).
- **APIs**:
  - All under "Moderation," "Users," and "Roles."

- **APIs**:
  - All under "Survey Responses."

---

### **11. Projects**
**Goal**: Support collaborative project management.
- **Features**:
  - Create projects (`POST /posts/projects`).
  - Manage participants (`POST`, `DELETE /posts/projects/{projectId}/participants/{profileId}`).
